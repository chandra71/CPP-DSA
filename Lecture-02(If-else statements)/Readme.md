# Lecture 02: If-Else Statements in C++

Welcome to **Lecture 02** of the C++ DSA series. In this lecture, we focus on conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements. These are the building blocks of decision-making in programming.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Topics Covered

1. **Basic `if` statements**
2. **`else` and `else if` conditions**
3. **Nested conditionals**
4. **Practical examples using conditionals**

## ðŸ“‚ File in This Lecture

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [If else statements.cpp](./If%20else%20statements.cpp) | Demonstrates the use of `if`, `else`, and `else if` to control program flow based on conditions. |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- Use `if` to check a condition.
- Use `else if` to check multiple conditions.
- Use `else` to handle the fallback or default case.
- Conditional logic helps your program **react** based on input and values.

This lecture is essential for implementing logic in future DSA problems.

Happy Learning!
