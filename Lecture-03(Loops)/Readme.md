# Lecture 03: Loops in C++

Welcome to **Lecture 03** of the C++ DSA series. In this lecture, we explore **loops**, which allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. Loops are essential for tasks like traversing arrays, solving problems with patterns, and reducing code repetition.

## 🟢 Topics Covered

1. **For Loop**
2. **While Loop**
3. **Do-While Loop**
4. **Loop Flow Control**

## 📌 Summary

- **For Loop**: Best when the number of iterations is known.
- **While Loop**: Used when the loop should continue until a condition becomes false.
- **Do-While Loop**: Similar to while, but runs at least once.
- Loops make it easier to work with data structures and solve DSA problems efficiently.
